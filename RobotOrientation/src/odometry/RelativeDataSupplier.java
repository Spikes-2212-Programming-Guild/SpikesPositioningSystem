 * This class represents an object with a changing value. </br>
 * The object may be a sensor measuring changing values, time-steps, or any
 * other data supplier.</br>
 * </br>
 * 
 * The instances of this class have one method called {@link #get()}, which
 * returns the difference between the current measured value and the last
 * measured value.</br>
 * </br>
 * 
 * Use an instance of this class when you are interested in the difference
 * between two measurements, and not in each measurment's singular value.
 * 
 * <p>
 * note - in this project, this class is used in order to give us the difference
 * between two measurements of an encoder instead of the value of each
 * measurement, and the time passed between each
 * {@link RobotOrientation#update(measurement,controlChanges, yawAngle,rollAngle, pitchAngle)}
 * cycle.
