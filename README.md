# SpikesPositioningSystem
<b><ul><li><i><a><strong>The calculate method of the OdometryHandler class should be called repeatedly, otherwise your robot's position

This is the Spikes Positioning System or SPS.

The Spikes Positioning System is a way to calculate your robot's position using two distance sensors and an angle sensor.
This program was written by the FRC team The Spikes #2212. For more information about us, visit <a href='http://www.spikes2212.com/'> our site</a>.

* ####  <a href='#Purpose'>What Is the purpose of the Spikes Positioning System?</a>

## <a name = 'Purpose'> The Purpose Of The Program
Many times during an FRC match the drivers have trouble seeing the robot and navigating the field, wasting precious time. The purpose of SPS is to provide the drivers with accurate informaion of the robot's whereabouts during the match and creating an easy way to calculate and use the robot's location in your code.
